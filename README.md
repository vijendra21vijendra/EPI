This repository is for the book "elements of programming interviews".
Here i will put solutions of almost all the questions.
and I know someone will say why should i read this they also have provided solutions.
But my point is that in this i will discuss about the thought process and I will also tell
you about the thinking that first comes into the mind then after how to think it in right way 
and direction.
In this manner it becomes a very good repo for all the software engineers or students who want 
to crack the coding interviews of FAANG.
